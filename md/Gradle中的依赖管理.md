## What is dependency management?

Software projects rarely work in isolation. In most cases, a project relies on
reusable functionality in the form of libraries or is broken up into
individual components to compose a modularized system. Dependency management
is a technique for declaring, resolving and using dependencies required by the
project in an automated fashion.

[Dependency Management Terminology](dependency_management_terminology.html).

## Dependency management in Gradle

Gradle has built-in support for dependency management and lives up to the task
of fulfilling typical scenarios encountered in modern software projects. We’ll
explore the main concepts with the help of an example project. The
illustration below should give you an rough overview on all the moving parts.

![dependency management resolution](img/dependency-management-resolution.png)

Figure 1. Dependency management big picture

The example project builds Java source code. Some of the Java source files
import classes from [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava), a open-
source library providing a wealth of utility functionality. In addition to
Guava, the project needs the [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit5/) libraries for
compiling and executing test code.

Guava and JUnit represent the _dependencies_ of this project. A build script
developer can [declare dependencies](declaring_dependencies.html#declaring-
dependencies) for different scopes e.g. just for compilation of source code or
for executing tests. In Gradle, the [scope of a
dependency](declaring_dependencies.html#sec:what-are-dependency-
configurations) is called a _configuration_. For a full overview, see the
reference material on [dependency
types](declaring_dependencies.html#sec:dependency-types).

Often times dependencies come in the form of
[modules](dependency_management_terminology.html#sub:terminology_module).
You’ll need to tell Gradle where to find those modules so they can be consumed
by the build. The location for storing modules is called a _repository_. By
[declaring repositories](declaring_repositories.html#declaring-repositories)
for a build, Gradle will know how to find and retrieve modules. Repositories
can come in different forms: as local directory or a remote repository. The
reference on [repository types](declaring_repositories.html#sec:repository-
types) provides a broad coverage on this topic.

At runtime, Gradle will locate the declared dependencies if needed for
operating a specific task. The dependencies might need to be downloaded from a
remote repository, retrieved from a local directory or requires another
project to be built in a multi-project setting. This process is called
_dependency resolution_. You can find a detailed discussion in [How Gradle
downloads dependencies](dependency_resolution.html#sec:how-gradle-downloads-
deps).

Once resolved, the resolution mechanism [stores the underlying files of a
dependency in a local cache](dependency_resolution.html#sec:dependency_cache),
also referred to as the _dependency cache_. Future builds reuse the files
stored in the cache to avoid unnecessary network calls.

Modules can provide additional metadata. Metadata is the data that describes
the module in more detail e.g. the coordinates for finding it in a repository,
information about the project, or its authors. As part of the metadata, a
module can define that other modules are needed for it to work properly. For
example, the JUnit 5 platform module also requires the platform commons
module. Gradle automatically resolves those additional modules, so called
_transitive dependencies_. If needed, you can [customize the behavior the
handling of transitive dependencies](dependency_constraints.html) to your
project's requirements.

Projects with tens or hundreds of declared dependencies can easily suffer from
dependency hell. Gradle provides sufficient tooling to visualize, navigate and
analyze the dependency graph of a project either with the help of a [build
scan](https://scans.gradle.com/get-started) or built-in tasks. Learn more in
[Viewing and debugging
dependencies](viewing_debugging_dependencies.html#viewing-debugging-
dependencies).
